              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
               <p style="font-weight: bold">In late 2012 two college students, by the names of Ethan muchnik and Harsh
                <br />Tiwary both realized that the environment around them was being destroyed by
                <br />pollution from gas guzzling cars. After years of watching the world indecisively
                <br />tackle the problem, they decided to help the environment themselves by making Lightwave:
                <br />an electric car company. From the beginning it was the company's stated goal to make modern
                <br />electric vehicles affordable to the masses.</p>

          <div class="caption-wrapper">
            <div class="caption">
              <p style="font-weight: bold">Of course the first step was making an actual car. After 2 years of research into how to make the ultimate
              <br />electric car, Lightwave released its first car to the world: Dune. This was a truly revolutionary Sedan
              <br />which offered an unprecedented 300 miles of range for an electric car. The people of America clearly
              <br />liked the car as they brought over 10,000 models by 2015, only a year after the car's
              <br />release. </p>

            <div class="caption">
              <p style="font-weight: bold">Of course, Ethan and Harsh knew that to truly give every American a new car,
              <br />they would have to compete in all the car categories. In March of 2016, two new cars were
              <br />announced by Lightwave, Alpine and Taiga which were a pickup truck and an SUV. Due to the recognition
              <br />that Lightwave got for Dune, Alpine and Taiga sold out even quicker. By the end of 2016 each of
              <br />Lightwave’s cars got approximately 150,000 orders. People were truly astounded on how modern, safe,
              <br />and efficient the cars were. Some newspapers commented that the cars were essentially going at the
              <br />speed of a wave of light. </p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold">Through most of 2017, Lightwave focused on two projects that were made
              <br />public, the building of its immense charging network and the updating of the cars through
              <br />software updates. In early August Lightwave showed the world River and Waterfall.
              <br/>Waterfall was a fast charger that could charge up any car in Lightwave’s lineup in less than 15 minutes for
              <br />free. Meanwhile River was the slower yet more numerous charger. Nevertheless the River could still
              <br />charge up an electric car in less than 45 minutes. In October, Lightwave released new LightVision
              <br />Safety features that ensured that every car would have the functionality to automatically brake
              <br />while also being able to drive on highways. This update was hailed as potentially life saving and
              <br />revolutionary.</p>

            </p style="font-weight: bold">At the end of 2017 Lightwave announced a surprise presentation. Many believed it would
              <br />be a new update or some new colors added, but Lightwave had something much more revolutionary in mind.
              <br />At this presentation Lightwave announced Neptune, the sports car and Boulder a semi-truck.
              <br />Neptune was flat out the fastest 0-60 car ever announced beating the previous record by nearly 10%.
              <br />Meanwhile, boulder had the biggest electric motor in any car or truck. Many hailed this as
              <br />the last step that was needed so that everybody could buy an electric car.</p>

              <br />in order to save our planet by making electric cars.We appreciate your interest and we hope that
